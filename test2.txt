Linear list of changes made to the file.
If I want to save the changes as it is, but experiment with the code separetly
I can create a seprate branch and do all the experiments on it
this branch, branches from the initial linear list which is called as the master.
I can still continue to make changes in the master branch which will not reflect on the side branch
