This is the first test file
I have created a test file and then commit it
So far I have learned that git is a version control system
main reason to use vcs is for keeping track of the changes made to the project/code
and also to collaborate between a group
GitHub on the other side is a webserive/website where we can apply the same git concepts
but it will be on a server and accesible by a group for collaboration
Files can be pushed to github from the local systems and accessed by different users
Repository is like a single project containing lots of files
COMMIT is a command for save
I'm making changes to this files after commiting the file for the first time.
