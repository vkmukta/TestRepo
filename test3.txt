Fork a branch:
if I want to use someone else's branch in my account and not disturb their branch, I should fork their branch
I get an exact replica with all the histroy

Pull Request:
If I want to send my work back to the main branch/account to add the data into the main account
I would have to send a pull request.
I don't have permission to push into the main account.
So I send a request saying could you like to pull this data into the main account?

Sending out from master branch is pushing
Taking in to master branch is pulling

Github already knows we can edit in main accounts, so when trying to edit it will show "Fork the branch and edit in your account"
or there is an option to fork.
