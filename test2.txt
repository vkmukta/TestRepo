Linear list of changes made to the file.
If I want to save the changes as it is, but experiment with the code separetly
I can create a seprate branch and do all the experiments on it
this branch, branches from the initial linear list which is called as the master.
I can still continue to make changes in the master branch which will not reflect on the side branch

This is the same file in test Branch and I am making changes here which will not reflect in the master branch

Under insights -> network, I can see the physical representation of what my branches look like.
Let me now try to send this branch back to master because I am satisfied with the changes on test branch
Push - sending something
Pull request - taking back something to master
Merge - 

Changes made from the testBranch are now added into the main branch.
These same changes can also be viewed in a physical representation to make it easier to understand.
